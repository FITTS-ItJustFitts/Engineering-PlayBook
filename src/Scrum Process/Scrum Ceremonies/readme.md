## Scrum Ceremonies

This section includes our general guidelines on how we handle srum ceremonies.

## Glossary
***
* **Demo** - This is an event at the end of every Sprint that is focused on presenting the work done during a Sprint. This event is also to be used for the Sprint Retrospective.

* **Product Owner (PO)** - This person takes the responsibilities of the product manager. He or she represents the end customer and other stakeholders communicating the overall vision of the product.

* **Sprint** - This is a time-box of two weeks or less during which a potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

* **Sprint Lead (or Scrum Master)** - This person makes sure that the team aligns its actions with Scrum principles, helps reconcile members, and resolve conflicts.

* **Sprint Planning** - This is an event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items.

* **Technical Team Lead (TTL)** - This person is responsible for the overall planning, execution and success of complex software solutions to meet customer’s needs.

## **THE DAILY STANDUP**
***

### **Time limit and focus**

A Standup should only last 15 - 20 minutes.

The purpose of the Daily Standup is to give every member of the team an opportunity to provide an update on their status. For the ceremony to work, it helps to have everyone standing up. Participants need to stay focused on their immediate status by reporting on:

    what they did yesterday
    what they intend on doing today
    any blockers

In order to effect this best practice when we conduct the daily standup, we should go around the room focusing on each participant, and not focusing on the board. The board is there to support status reports, but not be the focus. Every person should have a status, but not every story requires an update.

### **Who attends**

The general rule is that the `Scrum Master` and `all members of the development team` should attend **WITHOUT FAIL**. The `Product Owner (PO)` can opt to attend or not.

On the event that a `member` is unable to join or is going to be late, he or she should let the `Scrum Master` know this **BEFORE** the Standup. Furthermore, the member will be required to post thier Standup in **written format** on the Teams Channel. 

On the event that the `Scrum Master` is unable to attend or is going to be late, he or she should let the `members` know this **BEFORE** the Standup and choose one of the `members` to lead the Standup.

### **Best Practices**

* Every `member` should have a status, but not every story requires an update.

* Address the `Team`, not your Scrum Master, Managers or Team Leads.

* Focus on what you did `yesterday`, what you intend on doing `today`, and if you have any `blockers`. If it doesn’t fit within the above format, take the discussion off-line – and with only the relevant team members.
***

## **SPRINT PLANNING**
***

The purpose of Sprint Planning is for the team to appropriately commit to sprint work. A good sprint plan has enough work to keep the team busy, but not so much work that the team has items left over. Getting close to the goal on either end means you’re doing it right. Still, it’s possible to find the sweet spot.

>Sprint planning should be conducted at the **START** of every Sprint.

### **Best Practices**

* Review the last sprint to align for the next sprint.

* Take into account vacations, holidays, trainings and other commitments that would impact individuals ability to contribute to the sprint.

* Make it your team’s mission to complete every story in the sprint.

* Use story points to project how much work you can complete within a sprint.
***

## **DEMO**
***

### **Time limit and focus**

A `Demo` should last 30 minutes - 1 hour depending on work done.

During a `Demo`, completed (done) product backlog items are demonstrated with the goal of promoting an information-rich discussion between the `Scrum Team`, `Product Owner (PO)` and other stakeholders. 

> Sprint Retrospective should also be done at the **END** of the Demo.

### **Who attends**

The general rule is that the `Scrum Master` and `all members of the development team` should attend **WITHOUT FAIL**. It is also important that the `Product Owner (PO)` should attend the Demo.

On the event that a `member` is unable to join or is going to be late, he or she should let the `Scrum Master` know this **BEFORE** the Demo.

On the event that the `Scrum Master` is unable to attend or is going to be late, he or she should let the `members` know this **BEFORE** the Demo and choose one of the `members` to lead the Demo.

> The `Scrum Master` leads the Demo.

### **Best Practices**

* Focus on acceptance criteria. You’ve defined what done means for the story (right?), so focus your demo around proving that you’re actually done.

* Start with the demo in mind. Don’t wait to think about the demo until you’re done with the story. 

* Prepare. Don’t ad lib. Think through an interesting scenario to prove that you’ve satisfied the core acceptance criteria. Create any necessary test data.

* Practice. Run through the demo at least once.

* Tell a story. Center your demo around a realistic user solving a real problem. The point is not just to show that the software works, but to show that it’s valuable.

* Keep it short. If you work on your stories one at a time and get them accepted when they’re ready, you don’t need to exhaustively cover all your acceptance criteria in your demo. Instead, focus your demo on what’s interesting and what’s valuable about each feature.

## **Sprint Retrospective**
***

### **Time limit and focus**

A `Retrospective` should last only 10 - 15 minutes depending on work done.

> `Retros` should be done at the **END** of every `Demo`.

The `Sprint Retrospective` or `“Retro”` is a ceremony that helps uncover actions you can take to iteratively improve the software development process. While the purpose of the Retro is defined, the process is flexible. The key is to try things that lead to specific actions that the team can take to improve the process.

> The `Scrum Master` leads the Retros.

### **Best Practices**

* Find what works for your team.

* Dot-vote on retro items to identify the issues that the team wants to discuss the most.

* Keep track of the actions that the team has committed to taking and remind the team throughout the Sprint (even if it’s only on a sticky note).

* Get more ideas by asking about attending other team’s ceremonies. This will bring Insight into how other teams work and generate lots of new Ideas on how to improve your process.
