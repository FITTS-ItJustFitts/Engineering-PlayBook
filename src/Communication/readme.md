# Communication

This section includes our general guidelines on how we communicate on [Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).

## Teams Etiquette / Best Practices for Communication
***

* `@mention` individuals to get their attention and a response.
`@mention-ing` is equivalent to placing someone in the To or CC field of an email. Use `@` accordingly; don’t overuse it.

* `Urgency` in conversations is comparable to the urgency of an email. Don’t expect an immediate response even if you `@mention` someone in a conversation. Expect the response time to be similar to if you had sent an email. Use private chat for urgent messages.

* The `like button` isn’t for sentiment. Give a thumbs-up as an equivalent for “got it,” “sounds good,” and “okay.” This saves multiple unnecessary and annoying “I acknowledge” responses.

* `Reactions` are meant for sentiment. The thumbs-up is good for acknowledging a message, which can help keep work on task. Love, laugh, wow, sad, and anger should probably be reserved for less formal messages and jokes.

* Keep `private conversations` ad hoc. If the discussion starts getting into business decisions, bring it back to a channel. Work shouldn’t be completed in private chat.

* Use `video` when circumstances and internet connection support it.

* When it is your turn to speak on a video call `stare at your camera` while talking. This gives listeners the impression that you are fully immersed in the conversation.

* Stay on `mute` when you’re not talking. Nobody wants to hear you cough or listen to your dog whimper about needing to go out.

* Use the term `mic check` before speaking on a call. This is to inform members that you want to say something so that they can give you a chance to speak. The intention is to avoid multiple people speaking on a call. This is also intented to... you guessed it, check if your mic works and that you are not muted.

* Use the term `check` on a call when the speaker says `mic check` as feedback to the speaker to take the turn to speak and also as a way of informing them that they can actually be heard.

* When `sharing your screen`, zoom in. This helps your attendees see what you’re showing, which is usually smaller on their end.

* `Naming conventions` are critical when organizing teams, emails, and data. Since creating a team creates an email address for that team, it's important to stick to similar naming conventions. As an example, you would have "Teams IT" and "Teams Sales." The names of each team should be clearly descriptive of the team's purpose.
